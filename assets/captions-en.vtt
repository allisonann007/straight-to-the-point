WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.897 --> 00:00:08.769
We need to talk about sharing and I’m not talking about taxi and hotel apps I’m talking about real sharing.

2
00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.148
The kind my mother taught me about.

3
00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:15.818
Turns out sharing isn’t just good for the playground: it’s also good for grown-ups.

4
00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:19.601
Community collaboration and sharing are at the heart of human advancement.

5
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.463
These values built the web we love.

6
00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:29.851
The idea that evolution is nothing more than a selfish struggle for survival is utterly spectacularly incomplete.

7
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.243
It appears we need each other after all. 
8
00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:37.079
Harvard researcher Martin Nowak calls it the “snuggle for survival.”

9
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.767
We are hard wired for sharing. 
10
00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:44.478
When we share everyone wins: the giver the receiver and our communities. 
11
00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:50.690
Studies have shown that with just a few sharers in the mix they will inspire an entire culture of sharing. 
12
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.494
Now if sharing is at the core of successful societies then why do we have some of the most restrictive copyright laws in history? 
13
00:00:57.534 --> 00:01:00.514
The commons is an idea as old as we are 
14
00:01:00.574 --> 00:01:06.524
but today most of the world’s creativity will be locked away for decades even for those who want to share. 
15
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.517
You already know Creative Commons. 
16
00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:15.882
You’ve seen our logo on Wikipedia YouTube Medium Flickr and more – we’re even in the New York MoMA’s permanent design collection. 
17
00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:26.667
Every day creators institutions non-profits and governments use our licenses to switch copyright’s “all rights reserved” into CC’s “some rights reserved.”

18
00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.502
We are now the steward of a global commons 
19
00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:34.082
a universe of free and open content shared under simple terms 
20
00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:37.442
that can spark new ideas and solve global challenges. 
21
00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:41.441
Creators have shared over 1.1 billion works

22
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:43.551
including NASA’s iconic images

23
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:47.113
educational materials in every subject scientific research

24
00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:50.536
government open data 3D models and more...

25
00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:52.319
But quantity isn’t the key issue. 
26
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.500
We need the commons to be vibrant usable collaborative.

27
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.968
Creators need to find the best new works share feedback give gratitude get analytics and build networks around their interests and passions.

28
00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:07.999
It’s time to light up our global commons.

29
00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.897
Now this is where you come in.

30
00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:14.170
The effort to build a more connected commons is nothing short of transformationa 
31
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.400
And we need your help

32
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:26.079
It’s a strategic shift for Creative Commons that will require us to develop new infrastructure new tools and new resources; and it will require a new level of investment. 
33
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.689
That’s why we’re launching our most ambitious campaign to date. 
34
00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.151
And we’re off to a great start. 
35
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.230
But we need you to tip the scales. 
36
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:43.972
Remember those first few who share? They will inspire a culture of sharing where everybody wins: the giver the receiver and our global community. 
37
00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:46.464
Help us light up the global commons. 
38
00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:51.149
Help create a world that is more accessible equitable and full of innovation.
