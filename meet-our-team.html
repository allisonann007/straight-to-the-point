      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Straight to the Point was founded by Giap Nguyen in 2005. An avid and accomplished archer himself, he competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28 shooting (14 -  10 yard lanes and 14 – 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor shooting field.  Our state of the art educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with generations of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.  Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>
        <p>We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the professional archer.  Sign up for a group lesson, private class, schedule a birthday or corporate party or compete at one of our many tournaments.</p>
        <p>Straight to the Point Archery also offers homeschooling programs, YMCA classes, Boy and Girl Scouts achievement programs and several other youth group activities.  We are dedicated to teaching valuable life skills to the youth in our community through the wonderful discipline of archery.</p>
